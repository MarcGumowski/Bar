Bar
============

Bar implements a small time series bar chart made with D3.js.

The data are manipulated using R and then converted into .json format.

The chart represents the range of tariffs applied by the WTO members for the year 2006 and 2015 (or closest available year with data). Trade statistics used to build the dataset come from the World Tariff Profile 2016 publication and can be found in the databases of the WTO, ITC or UNCTAD. More information on the WTO web site: [Statistics](https://www.wto.org/statistics).

In order to start playing with data charts:

3.  Open it with your favorite web browser (Preferably Chrome or Firefox),
